# Compound Data Types 
CDT are those which are made of other data types - examples are - Tuples, Lists 

## Tuples 
Strings are sequences of characters, on the other hand, tuples are sequences of anything. 
They are a collection of data where the data can be of any type. Tuples are immutable, just like strings. So Tuples are immutable objects. 

## Lists 
Lists are mutable objects. This too pretty much works similar to strings/arrays.
