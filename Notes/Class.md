# Classes 
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new *type* of object, allowing to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods for modifying its state. 
> What is an object? 

Compared with other programming languages, Python's class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax 

Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data. 

>As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.

>**Important:**  As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the objectâ€™s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call.
